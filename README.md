<br/>
The Movie App which uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, uses tools such as ViewModel, Glide, Live Data, Retrofit, Coroutines, Koin Dependency Injection, Data Binding and Preferences DataStore to provide a user interface and display information about a film and its similar films. <br/>
- The ViewModel is used to manage the UI data and provide the necessary data for the screen display.<br/>
- Live Data is used to maintain and notify the UI when data is updated.<br/>
- Glide is used to upload images to Android.<br/>
- Retrofit is used to request and obtain information about the movie through the IMDB API.<br/>
- Coroutines are used to write asynchronous code synchronously, so that some actions like keeping data updated, for example, can occur simultaneously.<br/>
- Koin Dependency Injection was used to inject dependencies.<br/>
- Data Binding is used to bind UI components directly to data at compile time and make code easier to read.<br/>
- Preferences DataStore was used to store information about user preferences, as in this case, the act of "favorite" the movie in the heart.<br/>
